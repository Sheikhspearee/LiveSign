# ✋ LiveSign  

**Bridging the gap between sign language and regular speech – in real time.**

A real-time sign language interpreter embedded in your glasses bridging the gap between the deaf and the rest of the world instantly.

LiveSign is an AI-powered app that translates **sign language into English text and speech instantly**.  
By combining **computer vision** and **natural language processing (NLP)**, LiveSign makes communication seamless between signers and non-signers.

## 🚀 Features
- 📷 **Real-time sign recognition** using a smartphone or webcam.  
- 🧠 **AI-powered translation** – converts recognized signs into smooth, natural English sentences.  
- 🔊 **Speech output** – translated sentences can be spoken aloud instantly.  
- 🌍 **Multi-sign language support (future)** – starting with ASL and SASL.  
- 📱 **Mobile-first design** – optimized for real-time performance.

## 🔧 How It Works
1. **Capture** – LiveSign uses your device camera to track hand, finger, and body positions.  
2. **Recognition** – A computer vision model classifies gestures into words or phrases.  
3. **Translation** – NLP restructures recognized words into natural English sentences.  
   - Example: `ME DRINK WATER PLEASE` → **“Can I have some water, please?”**  
4. **Output** – Translated sentences appear as **text** and can also be spoken aloud with **text-to-speech**.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Computer Vision**: MediaPipe Hands, OpenPose  
- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow / PyTorch, TensorFlow Lite (mobile)  
- **Natural Language Processing**: Rule-based + transformer models for sentence reconstruction  
- **Frontend**: Flutter / React Native (planned)  
- **Backend (optional)**: FastAPI or Node.js for cloud inference

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Why LiveSign?
Over 70 million people worldwide rely on sign language as their primary language.  
Communication barriers often exclude the deaf and hard-of-hearing community from everyday conversations.  
**LiveSign bridges this gap** by turning signs into speech in real time — making conversations more inclusive.
